# Custom-Singly-linked-list
The aim of the microproject is to implement a custom single linked list in the form
of a class with a convenient programming interface.

The class is implemented as a template, and an iterator that will allow
the use of STL is implemented as well.

Features:

usage of smart pointers,
default constructor,
copy / move constructors,
destructor,
assignment / move operators,
adding container elements,
searching for an element,
sorting content (different criteria),
serialization / deserialization (reading and writing from byte stream).

The class can be declared and initialized with different data types as the following:
